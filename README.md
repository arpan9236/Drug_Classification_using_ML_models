**Problem statement**: The dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prathamtripathi/drug-classification) contains information about drug classification based on patient general information and its diagnosis. Machine learning model is needed in order to predict the outcome of the drugs type that might be suitable for the patient.

My objectives in this project: 1. Dataset exploration using various types of data visualization and 2. Build various ML models that can predict drug type.

The ML models used in this project are: (i) Logistic regression, (ii) Support vector machine with linear kernel or support vector classification (SVM or SVC), (iii) K-Nearest neighbours (KNN), (iv) Naive Bayes classification, (v) Decision tree classification, (vi) Random forest classification.
